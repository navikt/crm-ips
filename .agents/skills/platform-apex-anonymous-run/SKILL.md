# platform-apex-anonymous-run

Run anonymous Apex against the connected Salesforce org via `sf apex run --file`, capture the debug log, and narrate compile-time and runtime outcomes back to the developer.

This is the agent-side equivalent of VS Code's *Execute Anonymous Apex* (document and selection) commands.

This skill is **runtime, not generation** — for authoring `.cls` / `.trigger` files use `platform-apex-generate`; for running Apex unit tests use `platform-apex-test-run`; for deep debug-log analysis (governor breakdowns, SOQL-in-loop detection) hand off to `platform-apex-logs-debug`.

---

## Tool Restrictions

**Use ONLY the Bash tool** to execute `sf apex run`, and the `Write` tool to stage snippet temp files. Do NOT use MCP tools for execution.

---

## Anonymous Apex is NOT read-only

Anonymous Apex executes with the running user's permissions and **can perform DML, callouts, and platform events**. Treat every invocation as a write unless the developer has stated otherwise.

- **Verification-style scripts (preferred for "test this"):** wrap the body in a savepoint + rollback so org state is untouched:

  ```apex
  Savepoint sp = Database.setSavepoint();
  try {
      // ... code under test ...
  } finally {
      Database.rollback(sp);
  }
  ```

- **Production org heads-up:** if the resolved `<alias>` points at a production org (no scratch/sandbox markers in `sf org display --json`), surface a clear warning before running. This is informational only — there is no automated block. Always wait for an explicit "yes, run it" before executing destructive scripts in prod.

- **Never run anonymous Apex you did not generate or have not been shown** — if the developer pastes a snippet, echo it back and confirm before executing.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Identify the target org

Resolve the active org alias from configuration. If `target-org` is set, the `--target-org` flag may be omitted from the command, but always log which alias was used in the report.

```bash
sf config get target-org --json
```

Throughout this skill, `<alias>` is the resolved alias or username. If no `target-org` is set, ask the developer; do not silently default. If the org is not authenticated, re-authenticate with `sf org login web` or switch orgs with the `dx-org-switch` skill.

### Step 2 — Resolve the input mode

| Mode | When | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **File mode** | Developer points at an existing path ending in `.apex` (or any path they specify) | Run `sf apex run --file <path>` directly |
| **Snippet mode** | Developer pastes Apex code into the conversation | Write to `.sfdx/tmp/anon-<unix-ts>.apex` first, then run `sf apex run --file <tmp-path>` |

**Why a temp file for snippets, instead of an inline flag?** The current `sf apex run` CLI only supports `--file` (and interactive stdin). It does **not** expose an `--apex-code` flag. Even where inline code is supported by other tooling, multi-line Apex passed inline runs into shell-escaping pitfalls (single quotes in string literals, backslashes, embedded `$`). Writing to a temp file is the only reliable path for arbitrary snippets.

Verify CLI flags before deviating:

```bash
sf apex run --help
```

Supported flags (as of writing): `--file/-f`, `--target-org/-o`, `--api-version`, `--json`, `--flags-dir`. **Do not invent flags** — if the task asks for something not listed, surface that to the developer rather than guessing.

### Step 3 — Set up trace flags (for useful logs)

`sf apex run` returns a debug log only if a `TraceFlag` is active for the running user (or a streaming tail is attached). Recommended path — let the developer tail logs in another terminal:

```bash
sf apex tail log --target-org <alias> --color
```

This auto-creates a short-lived TraceFlag for the running user and streams logs as anonymous Apex executes. Mention this in the report so the developer can copy/paste it.

If no trace flag is set up, `sf apex run` will still execute the code and return compile/runtime status — only the *debug log body* will be missing or sparse.

### Step 4 — Snippet mode: write the temp file

Only applies when the input is a pasted snippet:

```bash
mkdir -p .sfdx/tmp
TS=$(date +%s)
# write the snippet content to .sfdx/tmp/anon-${TS}.apex via the Write tool, NOT via shell heredoc
```

Use the agent's `Write` tool (not a heredoc) so the snippet is preserved verbatim — heredocs subject the content to additional shell expansion. Echo the resolved temp path to the developer in the report. Do not auto-clean the temp file after execution — leave it under `.sfdx/tmp/` for inspection. The `.sfdx/` directory is conventionally gitignored.

### Step 5 — Execute

```bash
sf apex run --file <path> --target-org <alias> --json
```

- Always pass `--json`. Human-format output conflates compile vs runtime errors.
- If `target-org` is already configured, `--target-org` may be omitted, but log the alias used.
- The command exits non-zero on compile errors. Capture both stdout and the parsed JSON.

### Step 6 — Parse the JSON response

The `sf apex run --json` response shape (relevant fields):

```json
{
  "status": 0,
  "result": {
    "compiled": true,
    "success": true,
    "compileProblem": "",
    "exceptionMessage": "",
    "exceptionStackTrace": "",
    "line": -1,
    "column": -1,
    "logs": "...full debug log text..."
  }
}
```

Decision tree:

| `compiled` | `success` | Meaning | Surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| `false` | — | Compile failure | `compileProblem`, `line`, `column`, the offending source line |
| `true` | `false` | Runtime exception | `exceptionMessage`, `exceptionStackTrace`, plus log tail |
| `true` | `true` | Success | Whatever the script printed via `System.debug` (extracted from `logs`) |

`status !== 0` (top-level) means the CLI itself failed (not authenticated, file not found, network). Surface the raw error and stop.

### Step 7 — Surface the debug log

- **Short logs (< ~200 lines):** inline the log body in the report between fenced code blocks.
- **Large logs:** write the log to `.sfdx/tmp/anon-<ts>.log` and report the path. Include the last 30 lines inline as a tail summary.
- **Empty / missing log:** likely no active TraceFlag. Surface the Step 3 setup hint and proceed with whatever compile/runtime status was returned.

Highlight these patterns when present in the log:

| Pattern | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `LIMIT_USAGE_FOR_NS` lines | Governor consumption snapshot — flag SOQL/DML/CPU near-limit |
| `EXCEPTION_THROWN` | Unhandled exception within the anonymous block |
| `FATAL_ERROR` | Unrecoverable error — show the full trailing block |
| `SOQL_EXECUTE_BEGIN` count > 1 inside a loop | SOQL-in-loop hint (hand off to `platform-apex-logs-debug`) |
| `DML_BEGIN` count high | Unbatched DML hint |

Do not attempt full log parsing here — surface signals only, then hand off to `platform-apex-logs-debug` for deep analysis.

### Step 8 — Report

```text
Anonymous Apex run: <one-line summary — file or snippet, success or failure>
Org: <alias>  (mode: scratch | sandbox | production)
Source: <file path or temp path for snippet>
Compile: success | <error + line:column>
Runtime: success | <exception type + message>
Limits: <CPU=x/10000ms, SOQL=y/100, DML=z/150>  (only when log includes LIMIT_USAGE_FOR_NS)
Log: <inline | path .sfdx/tmp/anon-<ts>.log>
Rollback: applied | not applied | n/a
Next: <suggested follow-up>
```

## Examples

### Example 1 — File mode

> "Run `scripts/seed-test-data.apex` against my default org."

1. Resolve `<alias>` from `sf config get target-org --json`.
2. Confirm the file exists; if not, stop and surface `file not found`.
3. Run `sf apex run --file scripts/seed-test-data.apex --target-org <alias> --json`.
4. Parse JSON. Report compile/runtime status, log tail, and org mode.
5. Suggest: "If this seeded real data and you'd like to verify without persisting, re-run with the rollback wrapper (snippet mode)."

### Example 2 — Snippet mode (read query)

> "Execute `System.debug([SELECT count() FROM Account]);` and tell me the count."

1. Resolve `<alias>`.
2. Echo the snippet back; confirm.
3. Write the snippet to `.sfdx/tmp/anon-<ts>.apex` (Write tool).
4. Run `sf apex run --file .sfdx/tmp/anon-<ts>.apex --target-org <alias> --json`.
5. Parse `result.logs`; extract the `USER_DEBUG` line for the count.
6. Report: "Account count = N. Source: `.sfdx/tmp/anon-<ts>.apex` (kept for reference)."

### Example 3 — Verification with rollback

> "Test that this Apex correctly upserts a Contact, then rollback."

1. Resolve `<alias>`. If prod, surface a heads-up before running.
2. Wrap the developer's snippet:

   ```apex
   Savepoint sp = Database.setSavepoint();
   try {
       // ---- developer snippet begins ----
       Contact c = new Contact(LastName = 'Smoke', Email = 'smoke@example.com');
       upsert c Email;
       System.debug('Upserted: ' + c.Id);
       // ---- developer snippet ends ----
   } finally {
       Database.rollback(sp);
       System.debug('Rolled back savepoint.');
   }
   ```

3. Write to `.sfdx/tmp/anon-<ts>.apex`, execute, parse JSON.
4. Report compile/runtime status, the upserted Id from the log, and `Rollback: applied`.

## Failure Modes

| Symptom | Cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `No authorization information found for ...` | Org not authenticated, or alias is wrong | Run `sf org list --json`; re-auth with `sf org login web` or use `dx-org-switch` |
| `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '<path>'` | `.apex` file path is wrong or relative to the wrong cwd | Confirm absolute path; re-run |
| `compileProblem` non-empty in JSON | Apex compile error | Surface `compileProblem`, `line`, `column`; show that line; suggest a fix |
| `success: false` with `exceptionMessage` | Runtime exception inside the anonymous block | Surface exception type + message + stack; show governor counts if present |
| `logs` field is empty even on success | No active `TraceFlag` for running user | Tell developer to run `sf apex tail log --target-org <alias>` in another terminal, then re-run |
| `status !== 0` with no `result` | CLI / network / auth failure before execution | Surface raw stderr; do not retry blindly |
| Unrecognized flag error | Spec drift with the installed CLI | Re-check `sf apex run --help`; do not invent flags |

---

## Rules

- Always pass `--json`.
- Always resolve `<alias>` from configuration or the developer; never hardcode.
- Never use `--apex-code`-style inline flags — they are not supported by the current CLI and are escape-hostile. Always go through `--file`.
- Always echo a pasted snippet back to the developer for confirmation before executing.
- For verification-style scripts, default to wrapping in `Database.setSavepoint()` + `Database.rollback()`.
- For prod orgs, surface a heads-up but do not auto-block — the developer is in charge.
- Do not auto-delete temp files under `.sfdx/tmp/`.
- This skill executes anonymous Apex; it does not author, deploy, or test `.cls`/`.trigger` files. For those, hand off to `platform-apex-generate`, the deploy skills, or `platform-apex-test-generate`.
- For deep log analysis, hand off to `platform-apex-logs-debug`.
