# generating-lwc-components: Lightning Web Components Development

Use this skill when the user needs **Lightning Web Components**: LWC bundles, wire patterns, Apex/GraphQL integration, SLDS 2 styling, accessibility, performance work, or Jest unit tests.

## When This Skill Owns the Task

Use `generating-lwc-components` when the work involves:
- `lwc/**/*.js`, `.html`, `.css`, `.js-meta.xml`
- component scaffolding and bundle design
- wire service, Apex integration, GraphQL integration
- SLDS 2, dark mode, and accessibility work
- Jest unit tests for LWC

Delegate elsewhere when the user is:
- writing Apex controllers or business logic first → [generating-apex](../generating-apex/SKILL.md)
- building Flow XML rather than an LWC screen component → [generating-flow](../generating-flow/SKILL.md)
- deploying metadata → [deploying-metadata](../deploying-metadata/SKILL.md)

---

## Required Context to Gather First

Ask for or infer:
- component purpose and target surface
- data source: LDS, Apex, GraphQL, LMS, or external system via Apex
- whether the user needs tests
- whether the component must run in Flow, App Builder, Experience Cloud, or dashboard contexts
- accessibility and styling expectations

---

## Recommended Workflow

### 1. Choose the right architecture
Use the **PICKLES** mindset:
- prototype
- integrate the right data source
- compose component boundaries
- define interaction model
- use platform libraries
- optimize execution
- enforce security

### 2. Choose the right data access pattern
| Need | Default pattern |
|---|---|
| single-record UI | LDS / `getRecord` |
| simple CRUD form | base record form components |
| complex server query | Apex `@AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)` |
| related graph data | GraphQL wire adapter |
| cross-DOM communication | Lightning Message Service |

### 3. Start from an asset when useful
Use provided assets for:
- basic component bundles
- datatables
- modal patterns
- Flow screen components
- GraphQL components
- LMS message channels
- Jest tests
- TypeScript-enabled components

### 4. Validate for frontend quality
Check:
- accessibility
- SLDS 2 / dark mode compliance
- event contracts
- performance / rerender safety
- Jest coverage when required

### 5. Hand off supporting backend or deploy work
Use:
- [generating-apex](../generating-apex/SKILL.md) for controllers / services
- [deploying-metadata](../deploying-metadata/SKILL.md) for deployment
- [running-apex-tests](../running-apex-tests/SKILL.md) only for Apex-side test loops, not Jest

---

## High-Signal Rules

- prefer platform base components over reinventing controls
- use `@wire` for reactive read-only use cases; imperative calls for explicit actions and DML paths
- do not introduce inaccessible custom UI
- avoid hardcoded colors; use SLDS 2-compatible styling hooks / variables
- avoid rerender loops in `renderedCallback()`
- keep component communication patterns explicit and minimal

---

## Output Format

When finishing, report in this order:
1. **Component(s) created or updated**
2. **Data access pattern chosen**
3. **Files changed**
4. **Accessibility / styling / testing notes**
5. **Next implementation or deploy step**

Suggested shape:

```text
LWC work: <summary>
Pattern: <wire / apex / graphql / lms / flow-screen>
Files: <paths>
Quality: <a11y, SLDS2, dark mode, Jest>
Next step: <deploy, add controller, or run tests>
```

---

## Local Development Server

Preview LWC components locally with hot reload — no deployment needed. Run the commands in `scripts/local-dev-preview.sh` to start a local dev session for a component, app, or Experience Cloud site.

Local Dev commands install just-in-time on first run. They are long-running processes that open a browser with live preview. Changes to `.js`, `.html`, and `.css` files auto-reload instantly. Requires an active org connection for data and Apex callouts.

## Cross-Skill Integration

| Need | Delegate to | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Apex controller or service | [generating-apex](../generating-apex/SKILL.md) | backend logic |
| embed in Flow screens | [generating-flow](../generating-flow/SKILL.md) | declarative orchestration |
| deploy component bundle | [deploying-metadata](../deploying-metadata/SKILL.md) | org rollout |
| create supporting metadata (message channels, objects) | [deploying-metadata](../deploying-metadata/SKILL.md) | metadata deployment |
