# querying-soql: Salesforce SOQL Query Expert

Use this skill when the user needs **SOQL/SOSL authoring or optimization**: natural-language-to-query generation, relationship queries, aggregates, query-plan analysis, and performance/safety improvements for Salesforce queries.

## When This Skill Owns the Task

Use `querying-soql` when the work involves:
- `.soql` files
- query generation from natural language
- relationship queries and aggregate queries
- query optimization and selectivity analysis
- SOQL/SOSL syntax and governor-aware design

Delegate elsewhere when the user is:
- performing bulk data operations → [handling-sf-data](../handling-sf-data/SKILL.md)
- embedding query logic inside broader Apex implementation → [generating-apex](../generating-apex/SKILL.md)
- debugging via logs rather than query shape → [debugging-apex-logs](../debugging-apex-logs/SKILL.md)

---

## Required Context to Gather First

Ask for or infer:
- target object(s)
- fields needed
- filter criteria
- sort / limit requirements
- whether the query is for display, automation, reporting-like analysis, or Apex usage
- whether performance / selectivity is already a concern

---

## Recommended Workflow

### 1. Generate the simplest correct query
Prefer:
- only needed fields
- clear WHERE criteria
- reasonable LIMIT when appropriate
- relationship depth only as deep as necessary

### 2. Choose the right query shape
| Need | Default pattern |
|---|---|
| parent data from child | child-to-parent traversal |
| child rows from parent | subquery |
| counts / rollups | aggregate query |
| records with / without related rows | semi-join / anti-join |
| text search across objects | SOSL |

### 3. Optimize for selectivity and safety
Check:
- indexed / selective filters
- no unnecessary fields
- no avoidable wildcard or scan-heavy patterns
- security enforcement expectations

### 4. Validate execution path if needed
If the user wants runtime verification, hand off execution to:
- [handling-sf-data](../handling-sf-data/SKILL.md)

---

## High-Signal Rules

- never use `SELECT *` style thinking; query only required fields
- do not query inside loops in Apex contexts
- prefer filtering in SOQL rather than post-filtering in Apex
- use aggregates for counts and grouped summaries instead of loading unnecessary records
- evaluate wildcard usage carefully; leading wildcards often defeat indexes
- account for security mode / field access requirements when queries move into Apex

---

## Output Format

When finishing, report in this order:
1. **Query purpose**
2. **Final SOQL/SOSL**
3. **Why this shape was chosen**
4. **Optimization or security notes**
5. **Execution suggestion if needed**

Suggested shape — use `references/soql-syntax-reference.md` for exact syntax:

```
Query goal: <summary>
Query: <soql or sosl>
Design: <relationship / aggregate / filter choices>
Notes: <selectivity, limits, security, governor awareness>
Next step: <run in handling-sf-data or embed in Apex>
```

## Cross-Skill Integration

| Need | Delegate to | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| run the query against an org | [handling-sf-data](../handling-sf-data/SKILL.md) | execution and export |
| embed the query in services/selectors | [generating-apex](../generating-apex/SKILL.md) | implementation context |
| analyze slow-query symptoms from logs | [debugging-apex-logs](../debugging-apex-logs/SKILL.md) | runtime evidence |
| wire query-backed UI | [generating-lwc-components](../generating-lwc-components/SKILL.md) | frontend integration |

## Score Guide

| Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 90+ | production-optimized query |
| 80–89 | good query with minor improvements possible |
| 70–79 | functional but performance concerns remain |
| < 70 | needs revision before production use |
