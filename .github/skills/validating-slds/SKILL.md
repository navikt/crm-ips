# SLDS Quality Audit

Audit Lightning Web Components for SLDS compliance and produce an automated scorecard plus a required manual review gate. Combines SLDS linter output with supplementary static analysis to catch what the linter misses.

## Scope

Also valid for: auditing SLDS compliance across a project or component set, and before/after quality comparison after making changes.

Not for:
- **Fixing** linter violations — use `uplifting-components-to-slds2` instead
- **Building** new components — use `applying-slds` instead
- **Just running the linter** — run `npx @salesforce-ux/slds-linter@latest lint .` directly
- **Full WCAG accessibility audit** — this skill checks attribute presence only (labels, alt text, focus indicators), not contrast ratios, keyboard flows, or screen reader behavior
- **Framework-specific template auditing** beyond `.css`, `.html`, and `.js` files — JSX/TSX/Vue/Svelte outputs need additional manual review

---

## Quality Validation Process

```
1. Run SLDS Linter     → Collect violation counts (linter's job)
2. Run Analyze Script  → Check what linter doesn't cover (supplementary)
3. Agent Review        → Required manual review gate
4. Score & Grade       → Compute automated score + final recommendation
5. Generate Report     → Produce formatted scorecard
```

## Step 1: Run SLDS Linter

Run the linter to collect baseline violation data:

```bash
npx @salesforce-ux/slds-linter@latest lint <component-path> 2>&1
```

Count violations by rule. These feed directly into the **Linter Compliance** score:

| Rule | Impact |
|------|--------|
| `slds/class-override` | Breaks theming, dark mode |
| `slds/lwc-token-to-slds-hook` | SLDS 1 technical debt |
| `slds/no-hardcoded-values` | Breaks theming, accessibility |

**Linter Compliance Score** = `100 - (total_violations × 10)`, minimum 0.

**If the linter is unavailable** (no Node.js, no network access, CI sandbox restrictions): skip this step, note "Linter not run" in the report header, mark Linter Compliance as N/A, and compute the Overall score using the remaining 4 categories renormalized to 100%:

```
Overall (linter unavailable) = (Theming × 0.29) + (Accessibility × 0.29)
                              + (CodeQuality × 0.21) + (ComponentUsage × 0.21)
```

## Step 2: Run Supplementary Analysis

Run the analyze script to catch issues the linter doesn't cover. The bundled analyzer scans `.css`, `.html`, and `.js` files only:

```bash
node scripts/analyze-quality.cjs <component-path>
```

The script outputs JSON with findings organized by severity. It checks:

### CSS Checks (linter-complementary)

| Check | What It Catches | Severity |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Missing fallbacks | `var(--slds-g-*)` without a fallback value | Critical |
| Invented hooks (T051) | `--slds-g-*` tokens not found in `hooks-index.json` (requires `--hooks-index`) | Critical |
| Hook pairing | Background hooks without matching foreground hooks | Warning |
| `!important` | Specificity overrides | Warning |
| Magic pixel values | Hardcoded `px` not using spacing hooks | Warning |
| High z-index | z-index values > 99 | Warning |
| Outline removal | `outline: none` without alternative focus style | Warning |

### JS Checks

| Check | What It Catches | Severity |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Inline style assignment | `.style.*=` direct property assignment | Warning |
| SLDS class manipulation | Dynamic `.classList.add('slds-*')` manipulation | Warning |

### HTML Checks

| Check | What It Catches | Severity |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| LBC input labels | `<lightning-input>` without `label` attribute | Critical |
| Icon alt text | `<lightning-icon>` without `alternative-text` | Critical |
| Image alt text | `<img>` without `alt` | Critical |
| Heading hierarchy | Skipped heading levels (h2 to h4) | Warning |
| Positive tabindex | `tabindex` values other than 0 or -1 | Warning |
| Clickable divs | `<div onclick>` instead of `<button>` | Warning |
| Inline styles | `style="..."` attributes | Warning |
| Native elements | `<input>`, `<button>`, `<select>` where LBC alternatives exist | Warning |

### Hook Pairing Validation

The script checks that background/foreground hooks are semantically paired:

```
surface-* backgrounds     → on-surface-* text
surface-container-* bg    → on-surface-* text
accent-* backgrounds      → on-accent-* text
accent-container-* bg     → on-accent-* text
```

> **Limitation:** Hook pairing is checked at the file level, not per-selector. A file with `surface-1` in `.classA` and `on-accent-1` in `.classB` would pass because both surface and accent families are present. Review pairing correctness per-selector during manual review (Step 3).

### Invented Hook Detection (T051)

The script cross-references every `--slds-g-*` token in CSS against `hooks-index.json`. Any hook not found in metadata is flagged as critical — this catches the most common agent mistake of inventing hooks from naming patterns.

## Step 3: Agent Manual Review

These checks require understanding the component's purpose and cannot be automated reliably. Review each and classify findings as either:

- **Blocking** — incorrect blueprint structure, missing required states, or semantic/interaction issues that make the component not production-ready
- **Advisory** — worthwhile improvements that do not block shipping on their own

| Review Area | What to Look For |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Loading states | Does the component show a spinner or skeleton when fetching data? |
| Error states | Are errors surfaced to the user with actionable messages? |
| Empty states | Is there a meaningful empty state when no data exists? |
| Disabled states | Do interactive elements visually and functionally handle disabled? |
| Semantic HTML | Are `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>` used where appropriate? |
| SLDS blueprint compliance | Do cards, modals, forms follow SLDS blueprint structure? |

> Manual review findings are not automated, but they do affect the final recommendation. Do not report an automated grade as the only verdict.

## Step 4: Calculate Automated Scores and Final Recommendation

### Component Complexity

Before scoring, classify the component to give the score context:

| Complexity | Criteria | Report Note |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Small | 1-2 files, < 100 total lines | Score is high-confidence (small surface area) |
| Medium | 3-6 files, 100-500 total lines | Score reflects typical component |
| Large | 7+ files, 500+ total lines | Score reflects absolute issue count — even well-built large components may score lower |

Include the complexity classification in the report header. This prevents misreading a "B" on a 1000-line component vs. a "B" on a 20-line component.

### Automated Scoring Formula

```
Category Score = 100 - (critical_issues × 10) - (warnings × 3) - (info × 1)
Minimum score: 0
```

### Categories and Weights

| Category | Weight | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Linter Compliance | 30% | SLDS linter output (Step 1) |
| Theming | 20% | Script: fallbacks, hook pairing (Step 2) |
| Accessibility | 20% | Script: labels, alt text, focus (Step 2) |
| Code Quality | 15% | Script: !important, inline styles, z-index (Step 2) |
| Component Usage | 15% | Script: native elements (Step 2) plus manual semantic/blueprint review (Step 3) |

### Automated Overall Score

```
Overall = (Linter × 0.30) + (Theming × 0.20) + (Accessibility × 0.20)
        + (CodeQuality × 0.15) + (ComponentUsage × 0.15)
```

### Automated Grade Thresholds

| Score | Grade | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 90-100 | A | Excellent automated score |
| 80-89 | B | Good automated score |
| 70-79 | C | Acceptable automated score |
| 60-69 | D | Weak automated score |
| 0-59 | F | Failing automated score |

### Manual Review Gate

After computing the automated score, apply the manual review outcome:

| Gate | When to use it | Effect on final recommendation |
|------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Pass | No manual findings | Final recommendation can follow the automated score |
| Advisory | Only non-blocking manual findings | Final recommendation can be "Ready with follow-ups" at best |
| Blocking | One or more blocking manual findings | Final recommendation is **not ready for production**, regardless of automated grade |

### Final Recommendation Rules

Use both the automated score and the manual review gate:

| Final Recommendation | Conditions |
|----------------------|------------|
| Ready for production | Automated grade A/B, no critical findings, manual gate = Pass |
| Ready with follow-ups | Automated grade A/B, no critical findings, manual gate = Advisory |
| Needs work | Any critical findings, automated grade C/D, or manual gate = Blocking |
| Failing | Automated grade F |

## Step 5: Generate Quality Report

Use the template in **[report-format.md](references/report-format.md)** to produce the final report. Default to the **compact format** for initial output and expand sections on request.

The report includes:
- Executive summary with automated grade and final recommendation
- Manual review gate outcome (`Pass`, `Advisory`, or `Blocking`)
- Scores by category with visual indicators
- Detailed findings organized by severity
- Specific code locations and recommendations
- Checklist of required actions

## Quick Validation Mode

For a rapid quality check without full analysis:

1. Run linter: `npx @salesforce-ux/slds-linter@latest lint <path>`
2. Count violations by type
3. Report summary only

```
Quick Quality Check: <component-name>
─────────────────────────────────────
Linter Violations:
  • Class Override:     0
  • Deprecated Tokens:  3
  • Hardcoded Values:   5

Quick Automated Grade: C (estimated)
Run full validation for detailed report.
```

## Edge Cases and False Positives

| Situation | Guidance |
|-----------|----------|
| **Headless components** (JS-only, no HTML) | Skip HTML checks; score only CSS + linter categories |
| **Wrapper/container components** | May legitimately have minimal CSS; don't penalize low hook usage |
| **Intentional native elements** | `<button>` inside custom SLDS blueprints is correct; suppress C002 if inside an `slds-*` blueprint structure |
| **Components outside LEX** | LWR/Experience Cloud components may not use Lightning Base Components; note context in report |
| **Test/demo components** | Lower the bar — note in report but don't block on warnings |

If a check produces a false positive, note it in the report as "suppressed" with justification rather than silently dropping it.
