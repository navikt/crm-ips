# Generating Apex

Use this skill for production-grade Apex: new classes, selectors, services, async jobs,
invocable methods, and triggers; and for evidence-based review of existing `.cls` OR `.trigger`.

## Required Inputs

Gather or infer before authoring:

- Class type (service, selector, domain, batch, queueable, schedulable, invocable, trigger, trigger action, DTO, utility, interface, abstract, exception, REST resource)
- Target object(s) and business goal
- Class name (derive using the naming table below)
- Net-new vs refactor/fix; any org/API constraints
- Deployment targets (default to runSpecifiedTests and use generated tests where applicable)

Defaults unless specified:
- Sharing: `with sharing` (see sharing rules per type below)
- Access: `public` (use `global` only when required by managed packages or `@RestResource`)
- API version: `66.0` (minimum version)
- ApexDoc comments: yes

If the user provides a clear, complete request, generate immediately without unnecessary back-and-forth.

---

## Workflow

All steps are sequential. Do not skip, merge, or reorder. If blocked, stop and ask for missing context. If not applicable, mark `N/A` with a one-line justification in the report.

### Phase 1 — Author

1. **Discover project conventions**
   - Service-Selector-Domain layering, logging utilities
   - Existing classes/triggers and current trigger framework or handler pattern
   - Whether Trigger Actions Framework (TAF) is already in use

2. **Choose the smallest correct pattern** (see Type-Specific Guidance below)

3. **Review templates and assets**
   - Read the matching template from `assets/` before authoring (see Type-Specific Guidance for the file mapping)
   - When a `references/` example exists for the type, read it as a concrete style guide
   - For any test class work, always read and use `generating-apex-test` skill

4. **Author with guardrails** -- apply every rule in the Rules section below
   - Generate `{ClassName}.cls` with ApexDoc
   - Generate `{ClassName}.cls-meta.xml`   

5. **Generate test classes** -- Load the skill `generating-apex-test` to create `{ClassName}Test.cls` and `{ClassName}Test.cls-meta.xml`.  Apex tests are always required to be generated to deploy. No test file creation or edits can occur without loading the  `generating-apex-test` skill to generate tests.

### Phase 2 — Validate (required before reporting)

Writing files is the midpoint, not the finish line. Steps 6 and 7 each require a tool invocation and produce output that must appear in the Step 8 report. Do not summarize or present the report until both steps have run and their output is captured.

6. **Run code analyzer**
   - Invoke MCP `run_code_analyzer` on all generated/updated `.cls` files.
   - Remediate all `sev0`, `sev1`, and `sev2` violations; re-run until clean.
   - Capture the final tool output verbatim for the report.
   - Fallback: `sf code-analyzer run --target <target>`. If both are unavailable, record `run_code_analyzer=unavailable: <error>` in the report.

7. **Execute Apex tests**
   - Run org tests including `{ClassName}Test` via `sf apex run test` or MCP.
   - Delegate all test generation/fixes/coverage work to `generating-apex-test`; iterate until the tests pass.
   - Capture pass/fail counts and coverage percentage for the report.
   - If unavailable, record `test_execution=unavailable: <error>` in the report.

### Phase 3 — Report

8. **Report** -- use the output format at the bottom of this file.
   - The `Analyzer` line must contain the actual Step 6 tool output (or `run_code_analyzer=unavailable: <reason>` after attempting invocation).
   - The `Testing` line must contain the actual Step 7 results (or `test_execution=unavailable: <reason>` after attempting invocation).
   - A report missing either line is incomplete. Always attempt the tool invocation before recording unavailable.

## Rules

### Hard-Stop Constraints (Must Enforce)

If any constraint would be violated in generated code, **stop and explain the problem** before proceeding:

| Constraint | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Place all SOQL outside loops | Avoid query governor limits (100 queries) |
| Place all DML outside loops | Avoid DML governor limits (150 statements) |
| Declare a sharing keyword on every class | Prevent unintended `without sharing` defaults and data exposure |
| Use Custom Metadata/Labels/describe calls instead of hardcoded IDs | Ensure portability across orgs |
| Always handle exceptions (log, rethrow, or recover) | Prevent silent failures |
| Use bind variables for all dynamic SOQL with user input | Prevent SOQL injection |
| Use Apex-native collections (`List`, `Map`, `Set`) rather than Java types | Prevent compile errors |
| Verify methods exist in Apex before use | Prevent reliance on non-existent APIs |
| Avoid `System.debug()` in main code paths | Debug statements evaluate even when loggign is not active and consume CPU. Use a logging framework if required on main code paths |
| Never use `@future` methods | Use Queueable with `System.Finalizer`; `@future` cannot chain, cannot be called from Batch, and cannot accept non-primitive types |

### Bulkification & Governor Limits

- All public APIs accept and process collections; single-record overloads delegate to the bulk method
- In batch/bulk flows, prefer partial-success DML (`Database.update(records, false)`) and process `SaveResult` for errors
- Use `Map<Id, SObject>` constructor for efficient ID-based lookups from query results
- Use `Map<Id, List<SObject>>` to group child records by parent; build the map in a single loop before processing
- Use `Set<Id>` for deduplication and membership checks; prefer `Set.contains()` over `List.contains()`
- Use relationship subqueries to fetch parent + child records in a single SOQL when both are needed
- Use `AggregateResult` with `GROUP BY` for rollup calculations instead of querying and counting in Apex
- Only DML records that actually changed — compare against `Trigger.oldMap` or prior state before adding to the update list
- Use `Limits.getQueries()`, `Limits.getDmlStatements()`, `Limits.getCpuTime()` to monitor consumption in complex transactions

### SOQL Optimization

- Use selective queries with proper `WHERE` clauses; use indexed fields (`Id`, `Name`, `OwnerId`, lookup/master-detail fields, `ExternalId` fields, custom indexes) in filters when possible
- `SELECT *` does not exist in SOQL -- always specify the exact fields needed
- Apply `LIMIT` clauses to bound result sets; use `ORDER BY` for deterministic results
- When querying Custom Metadata Types (objects ending with `__mdt`), do NOT use SOQL — use the built-in methods (`{CustomMdt__mdt}.getAll().values()`, `getInstance()`, etc.)

### Caching

- Use Platform Cache (`Cache.Org` / `Cache.Session`) for frequently accessed, rarely changed data; set a TTL and always handle cache misses — cache can be evicted at any time
- Use `private static Map` fields as transaction-scoped caches to prevent duplicate queries within the same execution context; lazy-initialize on first access

### Security

- Default to `with sharing`; document justification for `without sharing` or `inherited sharing`
- `WITH USER_MODE` in SOQL and `AccessLevel.USER_MODE` for `Database` DML for CRUD/FLS enforcement
- Validate dynamic field/operator names via allowlist or `Schema.describe`
- Named Credentials for all external credentials/API keys
- `AuraHandledException` for `@AuraEnabled` user-facing errors (no internal details)
- `without sharing` requires a Custom Permission check
- Isolate `without sharing` logic in dedicated helper classes; call from `with sharing` entry points to limit elevated-access scope
- Encrypt PII/sensitive data at rest via Platform Encryption; never expose PII in debug statements, error messages, or API responses

### Security Verification

Before finalizing, verify: CRUD/FLS enforced (SOQL + DML) · explicit sharing keyword on every class · no hardcoded secrets or Record IDs · PII excluded from logs and error messages · error messages sanitized for end users.

### Error Handling

- Catch specific exceptions before generic `Exception`; include context in messages
- Use `try/catch` only around code that can throw (DML, callouts, JSON parsing, casts); avoid defensive wrapping of simple assignments/collection ops/arithmetic
- Preserve exception cause chains: `new CustomException('message', cause)` (do not replace stack trace with concatenated messages)
- Provide a custom exception class per service domain when meaningful
- In `@AuraEnabled` methods, catch exceptions and rethrow as `AuraHandledException`
- Fallback option: when no meaningful domain exception exists, catch generic `Exception` and either rethrow it or wrap it in a minimal custom exception that preserves the original cause.


### Null Safety

- Add guard clauses for null/empty inputs at the top of every public method; match style to context: `return` early in private/trigger-handler methods, `throw` exceptions in public APIs, `record.addError()` in validation services
- Return empty collections instead of `null`
- Use safe navigation (`?.`) for chained property access
- Never dereference `map.get(key)` inline unless presence is guaranteed; use `containsKey`, assignment+null check, or safe navigation first
- Use null coalescing (`??`) for default values
- Prefer `String.isBlank(value)` over manual checks like `value == null || value.trim().isEmpty()`

### Constants & Literals

- Use enums over string constants whenever possible; enum values follow `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Extract repeated literal strings/numbers into `private static final` constants or a constants class
- Use `Label.` custom labels for user-facing strings
- Use Custom Metadata for configurable values (thresholds, mappings, feature flags)
- Never output HTML-escaped entities in code (e.g., `&#39;`); use literal single quotes `'` in Apex string literals

### Naming Conventions

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Service | `{SObject}Service` | `AccountService` |
| Selector | `{SObject}Selector` | `AccountSelector` |
| Domain | `{SObject}Domain` | `OpportunityDomain` |
| Batch | `{Descriptive}Batch` | `AccountDeduplicationBatch` |
| Queueable | `{Descriptive}Queueable` | `ExternalSyncQueueable` |
| Schedulable | `{Descriptive}Schedulable` | `DailyCleanupSchedulable` |
| DTO | `{Descriptive}DTO` | `AccountMergeRequestDTO` |
| Wrapper | `{Descriptive}Wrapper` | `OpportunityLineWrapper` |
| Utility | `{Descriptive}Util` | `StringUtil` |
| Interface | `I{Descriptive}` | `INotificationService` |
| Abstract | `Abstract{Descriptive}` | `AbstractIntegrationService` |
| Exception | `{Descriptive}Exception` | `AccountServiceException` |
| REST Resource | `{SObject}RestResource` | `AccountRestResource` |
| Trigger | `{SObject}Trigger` | `AccountTrigger` |
| Trigger Action | `TA_{SObject}_{Action}` | `TA_Account_SetDefaults` |

Additional naming rules:
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Methods: `camelCase`, start with a verb (`get`, `create`, `process`, `validate`, `is`, `has`, `can`)
- Variables: `camelCase`, descriptive nouns; Lists as plural nouns (e.g., `accounts`, `relatedContacts`); Maps as `{value}By{key}` (e.g., `accountsById`); Sets as `{noun}Ids`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Use full descriptive names instead of abbreviations (`acc`, `tks`, `rec`)

### ApexDoc

- Required on the class header and every `public`/`global` method
- Include: brief description, `@param`, `@return`, `@throws`, `@example` where helpful

Class-level format:

```apex
/**
 * Provides services for geolocation and address conversion.
 */
public with sharing class GeolocationService { }
```

Method-level format:

```apex
/**
 * @param paramName Description of the parameter
 * @return Description of the return value
 * @example
 * List<Account> results = AccountService.deduplicateAccounts(accountIds);
 */
```

### Code Structure & Architecture

- Single responsibility per class; max 500 lines -- split when exceeded
- Return Early: validate preconditions at method top, return/throw immediately
- Extract private helpers for methods over ~40 lines
- Use Dependency Injection (constructor/method params) for testability
- Prefer composition and narrow interfaces over deep inheritance; extend via new implementations, not modifications
- Enforce single-level abstraction per method across layer boundaries:

| Layer | Owns | Must NOT contain |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | Event routing only | Business logic, orchestration |
| Handler/Service | Flow control, coordination | Inline SOQL/DML/HTTP/parsing |
| Domain | Business rules, validation | Queries, callouts, persistence details |
| Data/Integration | SOQL, DML, HTTP | Business decisions |

- Disallowed: methods mixing orchestration with inline SOQL/DML/HTTP; business rules mixed with parsing internals; validation + persistence + cross-system plumbing in one method

---

## Async Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Default | Key Traits |
|---|---|---|
| Standard async work | **Queueable** | Job ID, chaining, non-primitive types, configurable delay (up to 10 min via `AsyncOptions`), dedup signatures |
| Very large datasets | **Batch Apex** | Chunked processing, max 5 concurrent; use `QueryLocator` for large scopes |
| Modern batch alternative | **CursorStep** (`Database.Cursor`) | 2000-record chunks, higher throughput, no 5-job limit |
| Recurring schedule | **Scheduled Flow** (preferred) or **Schedulable** | Schedulable has 100-job limit; use only when chaining to Batch or needing complex Apex logic |
| Post-job cleanup | **Finalizer** (`System.Finalizer`) | Runs regardless of Queueable success/failure |
| Long-running callouts | **Continuation** | Up to 3 per transaction, 3 parallel |
| Delays > 10 minutes | `System.scheduleBatch()` | Schedule a Batch job at a specific future time |
| Legacy fire-and-forget | `@future` | **Do not use in new code** — see Hard-Stop Constraints; replace with Queueable + Finalizer |

## Type-Specific Guidance

### Service
- Template: `assets/service.cls` · Reference: `references/AccountService.cls`
- `with sharing`; stateless — no `public` fields or mutable instance state; keep public APIs focused and `static` where reasonable
- Delegate all SOQL to Selectors and SObject behavior to Domains
- Wrap business errors in a custom exception (e.g., `AccountServiceException`)

### Selector
- Template: `assets/selector.cls` · Reference: `references/AccountSelector.cls`
- `inherited sharing`; one per SObject or query domain
- Return `List<SObject>` or `Map<Id, SObject>`; use a shared base field list constant (no inline duplication)
- Accept filter parameters; always include `WITH USER_MODE`

### Domain
- Template: `assets/domain.cls`
- `with sharing`; encapsulate field defaults, derivations, and validations
- Operate on in-memory lists only; no SOQL/DML (belongs in Services/Selectors)

### Batch
- Template: `assets/batch.cls` · Reference: `references/AccountDeduplicationBatch.cls`
- `with sharing`; implement `Database.Batchable<SObject>` (add `Database.Stateful` when tracking across chunks)
- `start()` = query definition; `execute()` = business logic; `finish()` = logging/notification
- Use `QueryLocator` for large datasets; handle partial failures via `Database.SaveResult`
- Accept filter parameters via constructor for reusability

### Queueable
- Template: `assets/queueable.cls`
- `with sharing`; implement `Queueable` and optionally `Database.AllowsCallouts` when HTTP callouts are needed
- Accept data via constructor
- Add chain-depth guards to prevent infinite chains
- Optionally implement `Finalizer` for recovery/cleanup
- Use `AsyncOptions` for configurable delay (up to 10 min) and dedup signatures

### Schedulable
- Template: `assets/schedulable.cls`
- `with sharing`; `execute()` delegates to Queueable or Batch
- Provide CRON constants and a convenience `scheduleDaily()` helper

### DTO / Wrapper
- Template: `assets/dto.cls`
- No sharing keyword needed (pure data containers)
- Simple public properties; no-arg + parameterized constructors; `Comparable` when ordering matters
- Use `@JsonAccess` on private/protected inner DTOs that are serialized/deserialized

### Utility
- Template: `assets/utility.cls`
- No sharing keyword needed; all methods `public static`; `private` constructor
- Pure, side-effect-free; no SOQL/DML

### Interface
- Template: `assets/interface.cls`
- Define clear contracts with ApexDoc on each method signature

### Abstract
- Template: `assets/abstract.cls`
- `with sharing`; offer default behavior via `virtual` methods
- Mark extension points `protected virtual` or `protected abstract`
- Include a concrete example in the ApexDoc showing how to extend the class

### Custom Exception
- Template: `assets/exception.cls`
- No sharing keyword; extend `Exception` with descriptive names
- Supported constructors: `()`, `('msg')`, `(cause)`, `('msg', cause)`

### Trigger
- Template: `assets/trigger.cls`
- One trigger per object; delegate all logic to handler/TAF action classes
- Include all relevant DML contexts; if TAF: `new MetadataTriggerHandler().run();`

### Trigger Action (TAF)
- One class per concern per context; implement `TriggerAction.{Context}`
- Register via `Trigger_Action__mdt` (actions are inactive without registration)
- Name: `TA_{SObject}_{ActionName}`; prefer field-value comparison over static booleans for recursion

### Invocable Method (`@InvocableMethod`)
- Template: `assets/invocable.cls`
- `with sharing`; inner `Request`/`Response` with `@InvocableVariable`
- Method must be `public static`; non-static or single-object signatures will not compile
- Accept `List<Request>`, return `List<Response>`; bulkify (SOQL/DML outside loops)
- Decorator parameters: `label` (required — Flow Builder display name), `description`, `category` (groups actions in Builder), `callout=true` (required when method makes HTTP callouts)
- `@InvocableVariable` parameters: `label` (required), `description`, `required=true/false`
- `@InvocableVariable` supports: primitives, `Id`, `SObject`, `List<T>` only (no `Map`/`Set`/`Blob`); use `List<Id>` or `List<SObject>` fields for Flow collection I/O
- Always include `isSuccess`, `errorMessage`, and `errorType` (`e.getTypeName()`) in Response
- Return errors in Response (recommended); throwing an exception triggers the Flow Fault path — reserve for unrecoverable failures only

### REST Resource (`@RestResource`)
- Template: `assets/rest-resource.cls`
- `global with sharing`; both class and methods must be `global`
- Versioned URL: `@RestResource(urlMapping='/{resource}/v1/*')`
- Use proper HTTP status codes per branch (`200`/`201`/`400`/`404`/`422`/`500`); never default all errors to `500`
- Validate inputs (Id format: `Pattern.matches('[a-zA-Z0-9]{15,18}', value)`); bind all user input in SOQL
- Include `LIMIT`/`ORDER BY` in queries; implement pagination (`pageSize`/`offset`)
- Standardized `ApiResponse` wrapper (`success`, `message`, `data`/`records`); inner request/response DTOs
- Thin controller: delegate business logic to Service classes

### `@AuraEnabled` Controller
- `with sharing`; use `WITH USER_MODE` in all SOQL
- Use `@AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)` only for read-only queries; leave `cacheable` unset for DML operations
- Catch exceptions and rethrow as `AuraHandledException` with user-friendly messages
